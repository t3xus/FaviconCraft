# FaviconCraft
FaviconCraft is a drag-and-drop utility designed for efficient favicon management. It allows users to easily generate multiple sizes of favicon images from a single source image, simplifying the process for web developers and designers who need icons for various devices and browsers.

Functionality:
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Users can drag image files (PNG or JPG) onto the application window for processing.
Automated Favicon Generation: Upon dropping an image, FaviconCraft automatically scales the image to common favicon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128 pixels) without distortion, ensuring the icons are crisp and clear across different platforms.
Folder Organization: The application manages folders on the user's desktop, creating "Add Image" for input and "Exported Favicon Image Set" for output, streamlining the workflow.
User Experience: Minimalistic GUI with immediate feedback on successful processing, making it straightforward for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

Purpose:
Simplification: Reduces the manual effort required to create and manage favicons for websites or applications.
Consistency: Ensures all favicons maintain the quality and branding from the original image.
Efficiency: Speeds up the favicon creation process, which is often overlooked but crucial for web identity.
Technical Details:
Java-based: Utilizes Java's Swing for the GUI and Java's drag-and-drop capabilities for file input.
Image Processing: Leverages Java's BufferedImage and Graphics2D for high-quality image scaling and manipulation.
